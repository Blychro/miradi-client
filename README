PREREQUISITES

1. Java 1.4.2 or later



INSTALLING

Unzip the contents into some working directory, such as 
c:\Program Files\eam. 



SHORTCUT FOR EASY LAUNCHING

If you are using MS Windows, and you 
do install to C:\Program Files\eam, then you can copy the 
included shortcut (e-Adaptive Management.lnk) to your desktop, 
to create an easy way to launch the application.
If Java is not in your path, you may need to edit the shortcut 
to point to Java specifically. The details will vary depending on 
which Java you have installed, and where, but it would look 
something like this (you will need the quote marks):

  "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_02\bin"



MANUALLY RUNNING UNDER MS-WINDOWS

From a DOS prompt in the cmpdemo working directory, do:

  java -cp .;jgraph.jar; org.conservationmeasures.eam.main.EAM
  
If Java is not in your path, and you don't want to add it to your 
path for some reason, you may need to point to Java specifically. 
The details will vary depending on which Java you have installed, 
and where, but it would look something like this, entered all on 
one line (you will need the quote marks):

  "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_02\bin" -cp .;jgraph.jar; org.conservationmeasures.eam.main.EAM
