Upgrading From Earlier Versions

This is the first public release of Miradi. 

If you have an earlier pre-release version of Miradi 
installed, you can just install Miradi 1.0-Beta right 
over it.

If you had e-Adaptive Management installed, we recommend 
that you uninstall it first, and then install Miradi. 
Your existing e-Adaptive Management projects will be 
imported into Miradi. However, the Miradi Marine Example 
project will not be installed, unless you manually 
delete the eAM project directory before installing 
Miradi. This eAM directory is in your HOME directory.
