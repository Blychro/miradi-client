---------------------
Upgrading From Earlier Versions

This is the first public release of Miradi. 

If you have an earlier pre-release version of Miradi installed, you can 
just install Miradi 1.0-Beta right over it. This is also true if you were 
using e-Adaptive Management (the working name for earlier versions of Miradi).

If a Miradi (or eAM) project directory exists when you install Miradi, the 
new Marine Example project will not be installed. In order to install the 
example project, you must manually delete the Miradi (or eAM) project 
directory before installing Miradi. This Miradi (or eAM) directory is in 
your HOME directory.

If you installed e-Adaptive Management, we recommend that you uninstall it 
first, and then install Miradi. Your existing e-Adaptive Management projects 
(in the eAM directory) will be imported into Miradi.
