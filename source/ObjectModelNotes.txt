Notes based on a discussion with Nick, Dave, and Kevin
on 2006-04-04

=====================================================

CONCEPTUAL MODEL:

Scope
  Target
    DirectThreat/IndirectThreat/Opportunity
      Intervention

Scope contains targets
Relationships between others can be many-to-many
Aside from Interventions, represents the state of the world BEFORE
  our project has effects
Intervention also sometimes known as Strategy
Indicators can be attached to any node (Target, 
  DirectThreat/IndirectThreat/Opportunity, or Intervention)
      
=====================================================

BLUE WORLD

Vision (tied to scope)
  Goal (tied to target)
    Objective (tied to Threat/Factor/Opportunity)
    Outcome (possibly the same as an Objective?)
    
Represents the desired results of our project
Achieving Objectives leads to achieving Goals leads to realizing Vision
A Vision/Goal/Objective can be referred to as a "Result"


=====================================================

WORK PLAN

  ACTION PLAN
    Intervention
      Action
        Task
          Subtask
    
  MONITORING PLAN
    Indicator
      Method
        Task
          Subtask
    

Conceptually, Interventions and Indicators are linked to Objectives, 
  potentially in many-to-many relationships
"Indicator" here refers to the bundle of data surrounding the actual 
  indicator, which is technically just a measured data point
Interventions, Objectives, and Indicators serve as the linkages between 
  the Conceptual Model and the Work Plan.
