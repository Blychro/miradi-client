<P>Benetech is a Silicon Valley-based non-profit venture that combines the 
impact of technological solutions with the social entrepreneurship business 
model to help disadvantaged communities in our society and across the world. 
Many great technologies can easily be applied to social needs, but the 
profitability of such efforts rarely meets the financial expectations of high 
technology investors. Benetech specifically pursues endeavors that emphasize a 
strong social, rather than financial, rate of return on investment. Benetech 
explores the application of technology to major social issues in areas such as 
human rights, literacy, education and the digital divide. More information is
