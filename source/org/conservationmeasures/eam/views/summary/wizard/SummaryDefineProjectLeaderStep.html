Conservation does not happen on its own.  
The most important resources for any conservation 
project are the people who will be involved in 
designing and implementing it. Their commitment 
and skills will influence how effective the project can be.  
Your project team's membership will likely change over time.  
It is often helpful to think about:  
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Project Leader/Manager -</strong>
Although leadership responsibilities are often shared between team members, 
normally one individual is appointed as the overall project leader.  
Specific roles that the leader often plays include managing the performance 
of other team members, relations with key stakeholders, and the process of 
going through the project cycle.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Process Facilitator -</strong>
A process facilitator is a person who can help the project team through 
the planning process.  A process facilitator is typically part of the 
initial and/or the core team.  A good facilitator understands the key 
elements of the process, has good facilitation skills, and can keep your 
team from getting too bogged down in any one part of the process.  
This person does not need to be a &quot;professional&quot; facilitator, but should 
be someone who is intimately familiar with applying the planning process 
to &quot;real-world&quot; conservation problems.  
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Primary Contact -</strong>
The person or people outside the project team should contact to learn 
more about the project.
<p></p>
<p>
These roles can be assigned to one person, or to different people as needed.
<p>
</p>
Two other groups of people to consider are:
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Project Advisors -</strong>
People who are not on the project team, but to whom the team members can turn 
for honest feedback and counsel and who can champion your cause.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Project Stakeholders -</strong>
 Individuals, groups, or institutions who have a vested interest in the natural 
resources of the project area and/or who potentially will be affected by project 
activities and have something to gain or lose if conditions change or stay the same.  
Just because someone is a stakeholder does not mean that you will want them on your 
project team.  But if they are a key stakeholder, you also cannot ignore them in your 
analyses of the situation.
