Conservation does not happen on its own.  
The most important resources for any conservation 
project are the people who will be involved in 
designing and implementing it. Their commitment 
and skills will influence how effective the project can be.  
Your project team's membership will likely change over time.  
It is often helpful to think about:  
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Initial Project Team -</strong>
The people who conceive of and initiate the project.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Core Project Team -</strong>
A small group of people (typically 3-8 people) who are 
ultimately responsible for designing and managing a project.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Full Project Team -</strong>
The complete group of people involved in designing, implementing, 
monitoring, and learning from a project.  This group can include 
managers, stakeholders, researchers, and other key implementers.  
You need a wide range of skills on your project team.
Project team members should include representatives from the 
primary organization implementing the project, but ideally 
will include other partners as well.
