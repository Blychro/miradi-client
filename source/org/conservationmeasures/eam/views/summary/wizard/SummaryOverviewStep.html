<strong>Summary View</strong>
</p>
The &quot;General&quot; page contains information fields that most projects will want to fill in.  Some organizations 
will have their own custom data fields for their projects.  You can find these by clicking on the 
appropriate tab.  The summary page is also used to control several project-wide options such as the number of currency decimal places and the start and end-dates for your project that will affect other views such as workplanning.
<p>
<strong>Overall Application</strong>
</p>
All views have an interview pane on top and an action pane below. Use the previous and next buttons to <strong>move backwards and forward</strong> through the interview.  
<strong>You can resize or hide the interview pane</strong> 
by using the splitter and/or arrows.  
Use the buttons on the upper right to get context sensitive 
<strong>additional information, examples</strong>
, and 
<strong>workshop hints</strong>.
<p></p>
Note that the program automatically saves all changes so there is no 
&quot;save&quot; command.  You can save a copy under a different name using the &quot;Copy Project To&quot; command.
