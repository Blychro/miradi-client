				<P>Developing a results chain starts by 
				taking the factors from the conceptual model.  Both targets (green 
				ovals) and strategies (yellow hexagons) look the same.  But the 
				other factors have shifted as shown in the following diagram.  In addition, 
				the text of the direct threat and contributing factor boxes are now in brackets 
				indicating that the text has not yet been converted from a factor to a 
				result.

				To convert your factors to results, click 
				on each box and edit the text.  The key here is to transform 
				the factor describing the current state of the world into the 
				desired result.

				<P>
				Often, project teams implement strategies that they believe will contribute 
				to conserving the biodiversity in their site, but they do not formally state 
				their assumptions about exactly how the strategy will lead to threat reduction 
				and biodiversity conservation. Because the assumptions are not explicit, the 
				project team cannot test them and learn over time whether they are valid.</P>
				
				<P>For example, a team may decide that they will undertake education of school 
				kids in an effort to stop gorilla poaching.&nbsp;They may assume that 
				environmental education of school kids is a good thing to do.&nbsp;If they take 
				the time to lay out their assumptions in a results chain, however, they may find 
				that "connecting" the strategy to the target requires some difficult assumptions 
				as shown in the following diagram.</P>

	              	</tr>
	            	</table>
				
				
				<P>There are many points where the logic could breakdown.&nbsp;For example, it 
				may be hard to expect kids to convince their parents to stop poaching, 
				especially if the parents have no alternative source of income.&nbsp;A results 
				chain is an important tool to show exactly how you think your strategy will lead 
				to your desired outcomes, and what intermediate results you expect to see along 
				the way.
