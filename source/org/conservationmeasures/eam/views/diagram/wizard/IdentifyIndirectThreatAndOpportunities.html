<p>
To insert <a href='Definition:IndirectThreat'>indirect threats</a> and opportunities, select a threat and brainstorm 
what you think is driving that threat. Select the threat and click the 
<Insert an Indirect Factor> button.

<p>
The software will add a new indirect factor and open a dialogue box in which 
you can type the name and a comment. Using the mouse or arrow keys, move the 
factor to wherever you want it to be.  In most models, factors further away 
from the target are placed out to the left-hand side of the page.

<strong>Indirect threats</strong> and opportunities (collectively indirect factors) are the 
economic, cultural, political, legal, social, and/or institutional factors 
that drive direct threats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hint: </strong> We use the same shape to represent both indirect 
threats and opportunities because often, a given factor (for example tourism) 
can be both a threat and an opportunity.  Many people find it helpful to focus 
on neutral "factors" rather than trying to classify factors as being positive 
or negative.
