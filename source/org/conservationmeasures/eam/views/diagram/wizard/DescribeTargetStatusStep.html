<p>
For basic viability analysis, click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Details&gt;</code> tab of the target properties dialog, and 
make sure the Viability Mode field is set to <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Basic&gt;</code>.
Then use the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Status of Target&gt;</code>
 drop-down box to assign a status rating for the target. 
 This rating will appear at the top of the properties dialog, and 
 will be displayed in the diagram as a small ellipse next to the target.
</p>
<p>
Goals and indicators for this target will be identified and added later.

This step asks you to look at each of your conservation targets carefully 
to determine how to measure its &quot;health&quot; over time. And then to identify 
how the target is doing today and what a &quot;healthy state&quot; might look like. 
This step is the key to knowing which of your targets are most in need of 
immediate attention, and for measuring success over time. 
</p>
<p>
Assigning one rating to represent the overall status of most conservation 
targets is difficult task that involves making many assumptions.  
As a general rule, this rating process involves determining one or more 
attributes and/or indicators that represent the health of the target and 
then assessing the status of these indicators against a predetermined rating scale:   
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Very Good - </strong>Ecologically desirable status; requires little intervention for maintenance.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Good - </strong>Within acceptable range of variation; some intervention required for maintenance.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fair - </strong> Outside acceptable range of variation; requires human intervention.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Poor - </strong>Restoration increasingly difficult; may result in extirpation of target. 
If your assessment of a target involves more than one attributes/indicators, then you need to 
combine these ratings to get an overall rating for the target.

</ul>
