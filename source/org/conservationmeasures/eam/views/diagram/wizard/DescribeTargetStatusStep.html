This step asks you to look at each of your conservation targets carefully 
to determine how to measure its &quot;health&quot; over time. And then to identify 
how the target is doing today and what a &quot;healthy state&quot; might look like. 
This step is the key to knowing which of your targets are most in need of 
immediate attention, and for measuring success over time. 
</p>
<p>
Assigning one rating to represent the overall status of most conservation 
targets is difficult task that involves making many assumptions.  
As a general rule, this rating process involves determining one or more 
attributes and/or indicators that represent the health of the target and 
then assessing the status of these indicators against a predetermined rating scale:   
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Very Good - </strong>Ecologically desirable status; requires little intervention for maintenance.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Good - </strong>Within acceptable range of variation; some intervention required for maintenance.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fair - </strong> Outside acceptable range of variation; requires human intervention.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Poor - </strong>Restoration increasingly difficult; may result in extirpation of target. 
If your assessment of a target involves more than one attributes/indicators, then you need to 
combine these ratings to get an overall rating for the target.

</ul>
