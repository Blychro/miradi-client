<p>
Many threats affect more than one target. To link your threat 
to another target, select the direct threat, hold the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Shift&gt;</code>
key 
and then select the desired target. Then click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code>
button (the arrow).
</p>
<p>
You can also link direct threats to each other using the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code>
button.
</p>
<p>
If desired, you can also show 
 <a href='Definition:Stress'>stresses</a> 
from a direct threat on a target by clicking on a link between a direct threat and 
target and then typing the name of the stress into the blue 
box that appears on the arrow.

<p>
Many conservation projects can adequately capture the complexity of 
their situation by showing direct threats and targets.  Some projects, 
however, need to show how a specific direct threat affects a target.  
A stress is a degraded attribute of a conservation targets that is 
caused by human activities (e.g., low population size, reduced extent 
of forest system; reduced river flows; increased sedimentation; 
lowered groundwater table level).

<p>
<strong>Hint: </strong>	To keep your model reasonably simple and 
to make it an effective communication tool, it is suggested to show 
the major links between direct threats and targets. If you 
have a direct threat that has a negligible impact on a target, you 
should consider not including that relationship in your model.
</p>
<p>  
Remember, building your model is as much an art as a science. 
It will not be perfect, but it should do a reasonable job of 
representing what is happening at your site.
