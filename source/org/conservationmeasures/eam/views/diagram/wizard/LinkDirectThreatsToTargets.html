<p>
Many threats affect more than one target. To link your threat 
to another target, select the direct threat, hold the 
&lt;Shift&gt;
key 
and then select the desired target. Then click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code>
button (the arrow).
</p>
<p>
You can also link direct threats to each other using the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code>
button.

<strong>Hint: </strong>	To keep your model reasonably simple and 
to make it an effective communication tool, it is suggested to show 
the major relationships between direct threats and targets. If you 
have a direct threat that has a negligible impact on a target, you 
should consider not including that relationship in your model.
</p>
<p>  
Remember, building your model is as much an art as a science. 
It will not be perfect, but it should do a reasonable job of 
representing what is happening at your site.
