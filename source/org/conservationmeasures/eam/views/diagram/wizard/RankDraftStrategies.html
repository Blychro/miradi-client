				Once you have developed your draft strategies, you rate 
				each one in terms of its impact, duration, feasibility, 
				and cost by double clicking on a draft strategy and using 
				the drop-down ratings in the dialog box.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once you have developed all your draft strategies, you 
				can decide which one(s) you want to carry forward.  Unchecking 
				<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;draft&gt;</code> in the status field in the dialogue box will 
				convert the strategy from a light yellow "draft strategy" to 
				a dark yellow "strategy."
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Show Full Model&gt;</code> button (available on either the 
				toolbar or by right-clicking the mouse) to go back to the 
				full model and hide all your draft strategies.  Note that 
				your draft strategies are still retained 
				in <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Show Only Selected Chain&gt;</code> mode.

          		Draft strategies can be rated on the following criteria:
          	</p>
          	
          		<ul>
			  		<li>
			  			<p><strong>Impact -</strong>  Will the strategy have a high or low level of impact on the situation at your project site?</p>
			  		</li>          
			  		<li>
			    		<p><strong>Duration -</strong> Will the strategy lead to permanent or long-term change or will it only have short-term impact?	</p>
			  		</li>
			  		<li>
			    		<p><strong>Feasibility -</strong> Is the strategy easy or extremely difficult to carry out?</p>
			  		</li>
			  		<li>
			    		<p><strong>Cost -</strong> Is the strategy inexpensive to carry out?  Or is it prohibitively expensive?</p>
			  		</li>                    
				</ul>
          	
          	<p>
          		These ratings are then rolled-up to give an overall summary rating 
          		for the strategy.  Note that if a draft strategy is assigned 
          		any "red" colored rating, then the summary rating will also be "red."
