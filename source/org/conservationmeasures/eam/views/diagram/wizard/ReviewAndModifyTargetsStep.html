<p class='taskheading'>Review and Modify Targets</p>
<p>
Review your targets and determine if any should be split or lumped.
</p>
<p>
You can split targets by adding a new one and then renaming the 
old one (double click on the target and type the new name).
</p>
<p>
You can lump targets by deleting an existing target 
(select the target and hit delete on the keyboard) and renaming
the remaining one (double click on the target and type the new name).

<p>
You should consider lumping targets if they:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Co-occur on the landscape,
</li>
<li>
Share common ecological processes,
</li>
<li>
Share similar critical threats, and
</li>
<li>
Therefore require similar conservation strategies.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On the other hand, if an aggregate target contains species or habitats 
that do not meet the above criteria, you may want to think about splitting it.
</p>
<p>  
The decision to lump or split targets is as much an art as a science. 
You will have to use your judgment to determine what makes most sense for your site.
</p>
<br></br>
<strong>Hint: </strong> 
As a general rule, you should have no more than eight targets for your project.
