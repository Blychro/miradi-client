<p class='taskheading'>Identify Indirect Threats and Opportunities</p>
<p>
Although for some direct threats there may be only one contributing factor, for 
others, there may be many. The idea is to construct chains showing the sequence 
of indirect threats and opportunities affecting your threats.
</p>
<p>
You can add additional factors to the chain by using the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert a Contributing Factor&gt;</code>
button. You can add additional links by selecting 
one factor, holding the &lt;Shift&gt; key, selecting the second factor, and then 
clicking on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code>
button (the arrow).
</p>
<p>
You can also highlight a chain by selecting a direct threat factor, 
right-clicking the mouse, and picking the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Select Chain&gt;</code>
command.

<strong>Chains of factors</strong> are the basic unit for project planning. Consider, for 
example, the following:
<p>
<strong>Target: </strong> Montane forest
</p>
<p>
<strong>Direct threat: </strong> Unsustainable logging
</p>
<p>
<strong>Indirect threat: </strong> Government policies promoting unsustainable 
logging
</p>
<p>
<strong>Indirect threat: </strong> Limited awareness within government of 
sustainable logging techniques  (This indirect threat is really an underlying 
cause of the government policies that promote unsustainable logging.)
</p>
<p>
If you were trying to portray the above relationship in your conceptual model, 
you would link the factors in the following way:
