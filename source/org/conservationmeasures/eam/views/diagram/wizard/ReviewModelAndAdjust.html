<p class='taskheading'>Create a Model</p>
<p>
You have constructed your conceptual model in a series of separate steps. 
At this point, you should take a look at your model as a whole and ask 
yourself the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Does this model reasonably portray what is happening at my site?
</li>
<li>
Are all the key targets represented?
</li>
<li>
Are all the key direct threats represented?
</li>
<li>
Are all the key indirect threats and opportunities represented?
</li>
<li>
Are the link arrows properly placed?
</li>
<li>
Is anything major missing?
</li>
<li>
Will the model be understandable to my project team?
</li>
<li>
Will the model be understandable to people outside of my project team?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you answered "yes" to all of these questions,  
<strong>Click the 'Next' button below to continue.</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you answered "no" then you need to go back and fix your model.

<p>
Conceptual models should be considered dynamic.  As you learn more about your 
project site, you should periodically revisit your conceptual model and revise 
it as necessary. You should also think about the interventions you have chosen 
and whether, based on the new information about your site, you need to choose 
new interventions or modify existing ones.
</p>
<p>
Finally, a reminder - do not strive for perfection in your conceptual model. 
Strive for something that will be useful for your team - something that will 
help you portray what is happening at your site and determine what 
interventions you should be taking.
