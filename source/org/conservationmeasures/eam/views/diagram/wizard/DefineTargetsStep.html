Next, you need to add all of your project's 
<a href='Definition:ConservationTargets'> conservation targets</a>
 to your scope.
You should already have one target in your Scope box. You can double click on 
this target and type in the name of your target. You can also add additional 
information about the target in the comment box.

To add additional targets, click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert a Target&gt;</code>
button and then select 
the target and move it to wherever you want it to be.

The biodiversity at all conservation sites is a complex combination of 
genes, species, and ecological systems. Conservation practitioners thus
often find it useful to select a handful of 
<a href='Definition:ConservationTargets'>conservation targets</a>
(sometimes called biodiversity targets) that can represent this overall 
biodiversity so that they can focus strategies and assess whether 
conservation efforts are effective over the long term.  

Targets typically include key 
<a href='Definition:Ecosystems'>ecosystems</a>, 
<a href='Definition:FocalSpecies'>focal species</a>, or 
<a href='Definition:EcologicalProcesses'>ecological processes</a>.
Your targets should meet the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Represent the biodiversity at the site: </strong>
The focal targets should represent or capture the array of 
ecological systems, communities, and species at the project area,
and the multiple spatial scales at which they occur. A target that 
complements other focal targets in this respect is more desirable.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Reflect ecoregion conservation goals: </strong>
Focal targets that are grounded in an ecoregional portfolio are more desirable.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Viable or at least feasibly restorable: </strong>
Viability (or integrity) indicates the ability of a conservation target 
to persist for many generations. If a target is on the threshold of 
collapse, or conserving a proposed target requires extraordinary human 
intervention, it may not represent the best use of limited conservation resources.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Highly threatened: </strong>
All else being equal, focusing on highly threatened targets will help
ensure that critical threats are identified and addressed through conservation actions 
</li>
</ul>
