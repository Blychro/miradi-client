<h3>1B. Define Clear & Common Purpose:</h3>
<h4>Define Project Scope</h4>
<p>
The first step in building a conceptual model is to
put your project <a href=''>scope</a> to one side (usually either
the far right or top) of your workspace.
</p>
<p>
To insert your scope, click on the <em>&lt;Insert a
Target&gt;</em> button. The software will add a target to
the page with a Project Scope box around it.
</p>
<table width='100%'><tr><td align='center'>
<img src='images/DiagramWizard/NewScope.png' width='115' height='77'></img>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
You can select and drag the target to wherever
you want it to be. You can then click on this box
to enter your project’s scope.

<h3>Navigation Hints for the Diagram View</h3>
<p><font size='-1'>
Hint: In the current version of the e-AM software program, the scope is not a
      separate entity in the diagram, but instead is drawn automatically around
      all of your targets. You thus add your scope by adding a target to a
      blank diagram.
</font></p>
<p><font size='-1'>
A project’s <a href=''>scope</a> is the broad focus of the project. Projects focused on the
biodiversity of a specific place have a geographic scope (project area), such
as a national park or tribal fishing grounds. In some cases, you may need to
define your biodiversity targets before coming to a final decision about the
geographic boundaries of your project. If you are working in a watershed, for
example, you may be interested in conserving a forested area that stretches
from your watershed into a neighboring basin. In this case, the definition of
your targets would cause you to extend the geographic boundaries of your
project scope.
</font></p>
<p><font size='-1'>
Other projects have a thematic scope, with a focus on a population of wide-
ranging animals, such as migratory birds, mammals or sea turtles, or a focus
on certain ecological systems, such as forests, or issues such as illegal trade
of rare and endangered species or poverty.
</font></p>
<p><font size='-1'>
If there is any doubt about the basic scope of your project, then discuss the
options with the members of your project team and see if you have at least a
general consensus. If you can’t arrive at some basic consensus, then you
need to seriously reconsider whether you should split into multiple projects.
