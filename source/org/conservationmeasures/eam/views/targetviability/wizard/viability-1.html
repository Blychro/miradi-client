          		<P>Viability analysis&nbsp;asks you to look at each of your focal targets 
				carefully to determine how to measure its "health" over time. And then to 
				identify how the target is doing today and what a "healthy state" might look 
				like.&nbsp;Viability analysis is&nbsp;the key to knowing which of your targets 
				are most in need of immediate attention, and for measuring success over 
				time.&nbsp; Click on the <FONT color=#996633 >&lt;More Info&gt;</FONT>
