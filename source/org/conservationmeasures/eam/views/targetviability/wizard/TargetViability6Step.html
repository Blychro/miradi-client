			To track the source of your ratings, use the following 
				scale:</P>
				<UL>
				  <LI><STRONG>Rough Guess</STRONG> - Values are rough estimates by project team 
				  members. They are often an initial placeholder value meant to be improved down 
				  the road through use of other methods. 
				  <LI><STRONG>Expert Knowledge</STRONG> - Values are more refined estimates 
				  provided by experienced, reliable observers. These experts may be project team 
				  members, professionals managers, researchers, or members of a traditional 
				  community that have reason to take note of the conditions of interest and the 
				  experience necessary to provide reliable information. 
				  <LI><STRONG>External Research</STRONG> - Values are derived from research on 
				  this target at other comparable project sites, often obtained from published 
				  and unpublished scientific literature. 
				  <LI><STRONG>Onsite Research</STRONG> - Values are derived from research on 
				  this target at the project site. Note that this can include adaptive 
				  management by the project team!</LI></UL></FONT>
