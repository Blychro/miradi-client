Each 
<a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategy</a> 
will have on or more 
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a> 
associated with it.  On the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work Plan&gt;</code> 
tab, select a strategy that you want to focus on.  Think about 
the specific activities that you will have to undertake to carry 
out this strategy.  Click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Activity&gt;</code> 
 button to 
add a new activity and then type the name of the activity in 
the label box in the bottom panel.  Repeat for other activities 
for this strategy as needed.  You can use the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move Item Up&gt;</code> 
and the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move Item Down&gt;</code> 
buttons to change the order.
</p>
<p>
If necessary, you can also highlight an activity and click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Task&gt;</code>
button to add 
<a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a> 
 under this activity.  (If you are really detail 
oriented, you can even create sub-tasks under tasks.)

<p>
An 
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activity</a>
is an action that is carried out to accomplish one or more of a project's strategies.  
Activities should capture a discrete package of work that is assigned to one or more specific 
individuals to complete over a relatively short time frame. Each activity should be defined such that:
</p>
<lu>
<li>
It has clearly identified beginning and end points
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
The time and cost needs can easily be estimated
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
Its progress and completion can be easily assessed
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
It is distinct from other activities. 
<p></p>
</li>
</lu>
<p>
In many cases, breaking down a strategy into its component activities is a relatively straight 
forward process and the full suite of necessary activities can be identified. In some cases, 
however, where the work is more complex or new to the group, only the first few actions 
to launch the work may be apparent. In addition, if you find that an activity is difficult 
to define as outlined above, you may have to break it down into smaller <strong>tasks</strong>.
