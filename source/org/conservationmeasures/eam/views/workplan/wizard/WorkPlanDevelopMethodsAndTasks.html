Develop Methods and Tasks

<p>
Just as each 
<a href='Definition:Strategy'>strategy</a>  
will have on or more 
<a href='Definition:Activity'>activities</a>  
 associated with it, each monitoring 
<a href='Definition:Indicator'>indicator</a>  
will also have one or more 
<a href='Definition:Methods'>methods</a>  
 associated with it.  
</p>
<p>
On the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work Plan&gt;</code> 
 tab, select an indicator that you want to focus on.  
Think about the specific methods that you will have to 
undertake to measure this indicator.  Click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Method&gt;</code>
 button to add a new method and then type the name 
of the method in the label box in the bottom panel.  
If necessary, you can have multiple methods for each indicator.  
Repeat for other indicators as needed.  You can use the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move Item Up&gt;</code>
and the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move Item Down&gt;</code>
buttons to change the order.
</p>
<p>
If necessary, you can also highlight a method and click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Task>&gt;</code>
button to add tasks under this method.  (If you are really detail 
oriented, you can even create sub-tasks under 
<a href='Definition:Task'>tasks</a>  
.)

An 
<a href='Definition:Activity'>activity</a>
An activity is an action that is carried out to accomplish one or more of a project's strategies.  
Activities should capture a discrete package of work that is assigned to one or more specific 
individuals to complete over a relatively short time frame. Each activity should be defined such that:
</p>
<lu>
<li>
It has clearly identified beginning and end points
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
The time and cost needs can easily be estimated
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
Its progress and completion can be easily assessed
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
It is distinct from other activities. 
<p></p>
</li>
</lu>
<p>
In many cases, breaking down a strategy into its component activities is a relatively straight 
forward process and the full suite of necessary activities can be identified. In some cases, 
however, where the work is more complex or new to the group, only the first few actions 
to launch the work may be apparent. In addition, if you find that an activity is difficult 
to define as outlined above, you may have to break it down into smaller <strong>tasks</strong>.
