Assign Resources
</p>
<p>
To assign an existing resource to an activity/method or task, on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work Plan&gt;</code> 
 tab, select an activity/method or task that you want to focus on.  Click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add Resource&gt;</code>
 button at the side of the page and use the drop down box to select the appropriate 
human or material resource (do not include financial resources here).  
You can then specify the number of units for the resource in each upcoming quarter.  
Repeat the above for all other activities or tasks.
</p>
<p>
You can add multiple resources to one activity or task if necessary.
</p>
<p>
You can also assign resources at either the overall activity or task level for a given activity, but you cannot do both.

A 
<a href='Definition:Resource' class='definition'>resource</a> is a person or item that is needed to complete an activity/method or a task.  
There are three main kinds of resources:
<lu>
<li>
<strong>Human Resources:</strong> Members of your project team, other members of your 
organization, partners, advisors, consultants, or other people who can help accomplish tasks.  
Human resource units are usually measured in some time unit such as hours, days, weeks, or months. 
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Material Resources:</strong> Items such as vehicles, boats, fuel, computers, offices,
 conference rooms, plane tickets, telephones.  Material resources are either measured in a time unit 
(days of boat rental) or as their own unit (numbers of round trip plane tickets).  
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Financial Resources:</strong> The money required to pay for most human and material resources.  
Financial resources are usually figured in one or more standard currencies.
