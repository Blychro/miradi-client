            <p>An <strong>objective</strong> is a formal statement detailing a desired 
            outcome of a project, such as reducing a critical threat. 
            If the project is well conceptualized and designed, 
            realization of a project's objectives should lead to the 
            fulfillment of the project's goals and ultimately its vision.  
            A good objective meets the criteria of being:</p>
          
			<ul>
			  <li>
			  	<p><strong>Outcome Oriented -</strong> Represents necessary changes in critical threat and opportunity factors that affect one or more project goals </p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Time Limited -</strong> Achievable within a specific period of time</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <strong>Measurable -</strong> Definable in relation to some standard scale (numbers, percentage, fractions, or all/nothing states) </p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Specific -</strong>  Clearly defined so that all people involved in the project have the same understanding of what the terms in the objective mean </p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Practical -</strong> Achievable and appropriate within the context of the project site </p>
			  </li>          
			</ul>
