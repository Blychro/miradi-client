			<p><strong>4A. Develop Detailed Work Plans</strong></p>
			<p><strong><i>Develop Project Budgets: Budget Detail<i></strong></p>

			<p> 
				At this point, you should have already 
				developed your basic work plan showing 
				<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a>/<a href='Definition:Method'  class='definition'>methods</a> and 
				<a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a> and assigning 
				<a href='Definition:Resource' class='definition'>resources</a> to each.
			</p>

			
			<p>
				To add budget detail to an activity/method or 
				task, on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Budget&gt;</code> tab, select the one that 
				you want to focus on.  You should already see 
				the number of units for each quarter for that resource.  
				Using the drop down menu, you can then assign an 
				<a href='Definition:AccountingCodes' class='definition'>accounting code</a> and <a href='Definition:FundingSources' class='definition'>funding source</a> for that resource. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Hint:</strong>  The same resource may have 
				different accounting codes or funding sources for different activities/ methods or tasks.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you have already added the 
				cost per unit for a resource, at 
				this point you should see the total cost 
				for that resource for the quarter 
				and rolled up for the year.  The annual 
				amount is then displayed in the table 
				at the top of the page.  Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Resources&gt;</code>
				tab and select the resource in the table if you 
				need to edit the cost per unit information.
			</p>
			
			<p>			
				<strong>Hint:</strong>  If you need to adjust the planning horizon for your project, go to the project start and end date fields in the Summary View.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Hint:</strong>  You can edit the number decimal places for currency amounts in the Summary View.

			A <strong>resource</strong> is a person or item that is needed to 
			complete an activity/method or a task.  There are three main kinds of resources:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
			  <li>
			  	<p><strong>Human Resources:</strong> Members of your project team, 
			  		other members of your organization, partners, advisors, consultants, or other people who can 
			  		help accomplish tasks.  Human resource units are usually 
			  		measured in some time unit such as hours, days, weeks, or months.
			  	</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Material Resources:</strong> Items such as vehicles, 
			    boats, fuel, computers, offices, conference rooms, plane tickets, telephones.  
			    Material resources are either measured in a time unit (days of boat rental) 
			    or as their own unit (numbers of round trip plane tickets).  </p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <strong>Financial Resources:</strong> The money required to pay for most 
			    human and material resources.  Financial resources are usually 
			    figured in one or more standard currencies.</p>
			  </li>
