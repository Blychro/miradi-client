3A. Focus Your Monitoring

Determine What You Need to Know

<p>
Using your diagram, first look at the chains where you are taking action and 
thus need to measure 
<a href='Definition:StrategyEffectiveness'>strategy effectiveness.</a> 
At a minimum, you will probably 
want to think about indicators for each goal and objective.  You may also want 
to think about other factors in the chain that you need to monitor.
</p>
<p>
You should then consider any chains where you are not currently taking or planning
 to take action, but where you need to conduct 
<a href='Definition:StatusAssessments'>status assessments</a> 
over time. In particular, you will probably want to think about monitoring key targets and 
direct threats.

To develop a monitoring plan, you first and foremost must define the questions you want to answer. 
For most conservation projects, a monitoring plan answers two basic and interrelated questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Strategy Effectiveness -</strong>
Are the conservation actions we are taking achieving their desired results?
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Status Assessments  -</strong>
How are key targets, threats, and other factors at the project site changing over time?
<p></p>
The distinction between 
<a href='Definition:StrategyEffectiveness'>strategy effectiveness</a> 
 and 
<a href='Definition:StatusAssessments'>status assessment</a> 
 questions is not 
what is being measured (either can focus on biodiversity targets, threats, or other factors) 
but why you are measuring it.  Are you spending money and taking action to achieve some 
kind of specific result?  If so, you will want to measure the effectiveness of these actions, 
focusing in particular on your goals, objectives, and changes in other key factors.  
If instead you are measuring something that is not the focus of current conservation action 
but you want to determine whether action will be needed in the future, then you are measuring 
for status purposes.  Here, you will have to focus on the status of key targets, threats, 
and other factors.
