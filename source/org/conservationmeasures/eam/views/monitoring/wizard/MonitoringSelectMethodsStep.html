associated with it.  
Methods are assigned in the work plan view.

Select an indicator and click on the

button at the side of the page.  Fill in the label field at the bottom of the page 
with the name of the method.

If necessary, you can add multiple methods for each indicator.

<a href='Definition:Method' class='definition'>Methods</a> 
are specific techniques used to collect data to measure an indicator.  
Good methods meet the following criteria:  
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Accurate: </strong>
Gives minimal or no error
</li>
<li>
<strong>Reliable: </strong>
Results obtained using the method are consistently repeatable

</li>
<li>
<strong>Cost-Effective: </strong>
Not overly expensive for the data the method yields or for the resources the project has.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Feasible: </strong>
Project team has people who can use the method, as well as the material and financial resources to use the method.

</li>

<li>
<strong>Appropriate: </strong>
Appropriate to the environmental, cultural, and political context of the project. 
<p></p>
</li>

Methods do not need to be complex or sophisticated - if you can get the information 
you need using a simple, inexpensive method, it is far preferable to do this than 
to choose a complex, expensive method.  While the information you gather may be 
less precise, it may be sufficient for the types of decisions you are making.  
When planning for measuring results, you need to keep in mind that it should be a 
relatively small portion of your project budget.  If your methods for measuring 
results are too complex, you will not have enough money to implement actions and measure the results.
